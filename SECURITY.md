## Supported Versions

As spare-time/free-time developer I support this custom_component as best
as I can.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an issue in this repository using the `bug` template. I'm a
frequent visitor of my own repositories and will try to provide a
solution as quick as I can. I'm available on discourse using my
github alias for quicker response, but always file an issue so other
users are also informed.

Thanks in advance for helping us keeping the community safe.
